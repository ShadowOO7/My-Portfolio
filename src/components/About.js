              Hello! I'm Shekhar Nayak, a passionate and dedicated computer science enthusiast with a keen interest in competitive programming, Generative AI, MLOps, web development. I thrive on solving complex problems and building intuitive, efficient applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey in coding began with "my first 'Hello World!' in C,". Since then, I've honed my skills in various programming languages and technologies, including C++, Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to expand my knowledge base and improve my craft. When I'm not coding, I like to play Football, Badminton or go to GYM.
            </p>
